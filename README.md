## Overview

_CWLProv_ is an informal profile to define how to record provenance of a workflow run (typically [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) or [Nextflow](https://github.com/edgano/researchObject-Nextflow)), captured as a research object using Linked Data standards. 

There are three parts to this profile:

* [CWLProv BagIt](bagit.md), how the resources of an execution are _packaged_ using [BagIt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-16)
* [CWLProv Research Object](ro.md), how the resources of an execution are _related_ in an [RO](http://researchobject.org/)
* [CWLProv PROV](prov.md), how the workflow execution _provenance_ is modelled in [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/)

This repository may later also include formal profiles for computational validation, e.g. [BagIt profile](https://github.com/bagit-profiles/bagit-profiles) of included resources, [ShEx](http://shex.io/) for manifest content, and [PROV Template](https://provenance.ecs.soton.ac.uk/prov-template-2014-06-07/) to document PROV structures.

The [CWLProv white paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1208477) describes the background and motivation for this profile. For the avoidance of doubt, from CWLProv 0.3.0 this GitHub repository is authoritative of CWLProv specifications.

* 0.2.0 [https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/0.2.0](https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/0.2.0) Prototype as exemplified in [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1215611](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1215611) - (Note: No semantic versioning, `conformsTo` https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1208477 on PROV files)
* 0.1.0 [https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/0.1.0](https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/0.1.0) Prototype as exemplified in [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1208478](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1208478) (Note: No self-declaration of CWLProv version)


CWLProv is versioned using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), following the pattern `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `1.2.0`).

To determine version compatibility we consider the packaging of a CWLProv RO as a kind of "API". Examples of changes to CWLProv:

* Major version change: Removal of resource type, change of format of PROV, removing annotations, changing namespaces, removing PROV statement patterns
* Minor version change: Adding other resources, adding annotations, additional properties, changing entity identifier scheme, change of file paths in RO, minor change of underlying syntax and package version, adding/augmenting PROV statement patterns, conformance to [PROV constraints](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-constraints/)
* Patch version change: Fixing syntactical typos (e.g. invalid or inefficient [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)), inconsistencies in textual language, adding [inferred PROV statements](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-sem/)

This means that consumers of CWLProv can make strong assumptions on backwards and forwards compatibility:

* Major: Unsupported major versions can't be safely parsed
* Minor: Can safely parse (but not reproduce) newer versions. Parsing older versions is safe if later CWLProv additions are handled as optional.
* Patch: Differences can usually be safely ignored

_Unless a patch version is affecting the output, the declared profile SHOULD have patch version `0` even if the code was implemented with a later CWLProv._

**Tip:** You may spot that _change of file paths_ is classified as minor, that is because paths can be found dynamically by following links from the manifest, its annotations and the PROV traces. This is similar to REST principles where URI templates should not be assumed, but followed from links._

The current version of CWLProv have major `0`, indicating that [disruptive changes](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4) may occur before the profile stabilize at `1.x.y`.

Each CWLProv version has a `w3id.org` _permalink_ that SHOULD be declared inside the [RO](ro.md) to indicate its conformance.
